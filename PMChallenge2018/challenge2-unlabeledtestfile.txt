2	I agree with John K we need to punch Russia on the mouth #GOPDebate
2	Right now the Cruz/Blitzer moment will be the most replayed moment from this debate.  And it won't help Cruz.  #GOPDebate

2	You're center stage because you're a fucking free carnival, Trump. That's why you're center stage. #GOPDebate
2	@realDonaldTrump people like what I say that's why I'm center stage #CNNDebate #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate @RealBenCarson so classy. Great to have a moment of silence to respect and remember our recently lost brothers and sisters.
2	Fairly certain this debate is a terrorist attack on my brain #GOPDebate
2	No, Donald Trump, no one likes or respects what you have to say. Sit down. You will not represent our country. #GOPDebate
2	Wow, #ChrisChristie is jacking up the terror alert to an 11, nakedly fear mongering at the #GOPDebate
2	What people like what you say Trump? #GOPDebate
2	.@CNNPolitics Ted Cruz is scary and seems so angry.  I don't want someone like him in charge of USA.  #GOPDebate https://t.co/PT9RsKeqZ4
2	#GOPDebate Trump always just talks about polls. Substance, anyone?
2	@realDonaldTrump sounded most presidential yet. I love that man! @CNN #GOPDebate @FoxNews @MSNBC @OANN @DanScavino #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
2	Seriously @marcorubio? Is your Dad smoking 3 cigars a day in Vegas the most important thing for you open that you #GOPdebate with?
2	Carson called for a moment of silence for the St.. Bernardino victims. So far we're not short of deama.   #GOPDebate
2	The elevator music in the background at @DFWAirport is giving the #GOPDebate a real upbeat, jazzy vibe. #SilverLining
2	Democrats believe in raising the minimum wage. These GOPers on stage don’t. #GOPDebate #OMGOP https://t.co/vMxiyFL5WE
2	#BenCarson just asked Congress to declare war on #ISIS. But shouldn't they at least debate the #AUMF first? #GOPDebate
2	Trump gives himself credit for opening up the conversation on 'Radical Islam', world laughs. #GOPDebate
2	Already can't stand what these people are saying #GOPDebate
2	Did Trump just stump? He seemed almost presidential. Drink? #GOPDebate
2	@realDonaldTrump sedated so far.  #GOPDebate

2	The tone of this debate is so somber and eerie. #GOPDebate
2	TRUMP: Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect. We've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up. #gopdebate
2	I will eat a dorito every time they say #HillaryClinton #GOPDebate
2	#GOP should really take a listen to @JohnKasich he truly makes sense. #GOPDebate https://t.co/UleDANSmWp

2	@realDonaldTrump had a rambling but calm opening set of remarks. #StandWithRand #GOPDebate
2	The polls show Ted Cruz surging. Can he maintain the momentum? https://t.co/pVSwJWvTdM #GOPDebate via Forbes

2	Time for a commercial break. I need a refill. #GOPDebate
2	#tmlt also @marcorubio this is just a group of weird-eared-os #GOPDebate
2	Maybe Rubio doesn't want to talk about classified information because he skipped the briefing and doesn't know what it is. #GOPDebate
2	No one told Christie that a GOP candidate had to be the size of an actual elephant #GOPDebate
2	@RandPaul just punched  @marcorubio in the mouth #GOPDebate

2	Rand and Marco remind me of Alphalpha and Spanky arguing on the playground....#GOPDebate
2	Currently watching the #GOPDebate 👀 I'm definitely what you call a South African American 😬 #politicswillhaveyou
2	.@marcorubio and @RandPaul are throwing serious shade at each other right now. #GOPDebate
2	Not 1, not 2, but 3 of these GOP jokers are actual U.S. Senators! Retweet if you think it's time to turn the Senate Blue again. #GOPDebate

2	What's good, Marco? #GOPDebate https://t.co/T25aHvOQZV
2	Meta data is not the issue: open borders need to be closed b/c every terrorist attack since #9/11 stems from immigration issues. #GOPDebate

2	Did Carson go take a nap? #GOPDebate
2	I'm sure Rubio is NOT aligned with the Dems in most issues. #GOPDebate

2	TERRORISTS. #GOPDebate
2	Can anyone tell me why everyone in the #GOPDebate refers to each other by their first names? Is this a thing in American Politics?
2	Still walking. It's a big mall. I feel good though. I feel like we're winning. #CruzCrew #TedCruz #canadiansfortedcruz #GOPDebate

2	Rand-paul looks like if Edward Norton went through a sad-machine. #GOPDebate

2	Carson will just confuse Mosques with grain silos #GOPDebate

2	Nixon wins. #GOPDebate  https://t.co/ofCE2Y1E72
2	Actually Christie, I was wondering if alcoholism is really not being able to stand a #GOPDebate without wanting to take a shot.. #CNNDebate
2	He has made this abundantly clear already thanks #GOPDebate  https://t.co/nOJ28vBMxj
2	4 dicks?! Christie's war on men begins. #GOPDebate
2	Gov. Christie has been on his game tonight. Not really caring about Dr. Carson since he continues to sink in the polls. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate Good idea on Christie's part to hit on the lack of action in Congress. No one likes Congress.
2	Good job, @ChrisChristie but people know that those decisions in the #Senate are important. #CNNDebate #GOPDebate
2	Yes! I almost forgot @RealBenCarson was on stage! He starts w a complaint on not getting time #GOPDebate
2	Carson now complaining about the lack of airtime. #GOPDebate
2	I noticed that too @RealBenCarson. There's people at home watching this only for you! #GOPDebate
2	@BritniDWrites He's trying to be #RudyGiuliani without the substance or competence. We see right thru him.  #ChrisChristie #GOPDebate
2	Ben Carson just complained about not getting any questions and asked the audience to pay attention to it .üòê #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate. Try to pay attention.  He's eating hummus.
2	Oh Dr. Carson no one likes a whiner. #GOPDebate
2	Jesus, Christie is being destroyed so far... by himself #GOPDebate #GOP #tytlive
2	Whining about speaking time comes off as petty. Why do they do it? #GOPDebate
2	Rubio cheated out of 30 sec. rebuttal. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate my turn, what do you plan to do about the fucking problems here in our homeland?
2	Oops looks like Ben Carson's nap ended a little too early. #GOPDebate
2	Hey @ChrisChristie -- Those details MATTER.  I CARE ABOUT THEM!  Only the idiot sheeple do not care.  Fuck them, and FUCK YOU.  #GopDebate
2	Somebody tell Christie that we don't believe him. People still waiting on the #hurricanesandy checks #GOPDebate
2	Pretty sure Ben Carson is doing the macarena with his hands. #GOPDebate
2	@BenCarson2016 is a whiner, and really dumb smart person. #GopDebate
2	#GOPDebate yay Chris Christie ! Action over arguing on senate floor.
2	Mmmm glazed over eyeballs #GOPDebate
2	The-ay-ter, hummus. Ben Carson has some funky words #GOPDebate

2	Ben Carson, is so soft spoken, get some bass in your voice bro. #GOPDebate
2	Stop whining about how much time you have and actually use it to debate #GOPDebate
2	I‚Äôm sorry, but Carson‚Äôs tie and suit combo is terrible. Of all the sins he‚Äôs committed, this is the most egregious. #thelaststraw #GOPDebate
2	#BenCarson going with the Jim Webb start. Bold move. #CNN #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate #CruzCrew This whining about who has had as much time (such as Carson and Rubio have done) diminishes them as candidates.
2	Dr. Carson with the throwback Thursday to the alien and sedition acts #GOPDebate
2	Oh Carson! Disturbed he hasn't been called upon until now.  #GOPDebate
2	@ChrisChristie stopped four dicks. Don't ever forget. #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	I forgot Ben Carson was at the debate #GOPDebate
2	I wonder if Carson pulled an all-nighter to study for this debate. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate I reached a point where I get as annoyed by Carson speaking as I do by Obama...
2	#DonaldTrump we hit you with the attack question. Now we don't need to ask you anything else.  #GOPDebate

2	Dr. Carson is so polite. #GOPDebate
2	Ben is slick. Pay attention to what I say but understand I never get to say it. #GOPDebate
2	Did Dr. Ben Carson just wake up from a nap? #GOPDebate
2	It's a conspiracy ben, didn't you know #GOPDebate
2	Stopped4dicks #Christie2016  #GOPDebate
2	Don't get rid of PC BRO! #GOPDebate #SouthPark
2	Carson says if people meet at places &amp; say radical things, they must be monitored. #GOPDebate
2	Whining about not getting to talk or saying you get to talk again because someone mentioned you is the worssssst #GOPDebate
2	I'm not getting enough time to speak, so I'll use my time to complain about not getting enough time to speak. #GOPDebate
2	Hm. @ChrisChristie rants about how tough he is on #terror. Remind me again who killed #OsamaBinLaden? Right! @POTUS #CNNDebate or #GOPdebate
2	Aw, too bad @RealBenCarson is 1st to whine about not getting enough time at #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	#GOPDebate WE STOPPED FOUR DICKS!
2	@RealBenCarson sounds like #kermitthefrog just slower #GOPDebate
2	Ben Carson - a warrior for speaking time. #GOPDebate
2	Why don't candidates understand that lecturing about their lack of time is not a good look? #GOPDebate
2	Are Rand and Rubio twinning? #GOPDebate
2	@ChrisChristie is coming off strong! @CNNPolitics #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate how do i revoke my american citizenship if either trump, cruz, huckabee, or any republican for that matter becomes our president?
2	@realDonaldTrump #GOPDebate It's nice that you don't point fingers (who cares) what the last president did .. You talk about what you can do
2	You need to be awake to answer questions Ben #gopdebate
2	Love the passion, smarts, and articulation of Senator Marco Rubio. He'd make a great President.  #GOPDebate
2	Carson looks comatose.  #GOPDebate
2	@tedcruz is clear and precise, in command of the facts and lays out a sound policy for immigration reform. #GOPDebate #Tcot
2	Yikes, Carson schooling CNN #GOPDebate
2	Carson's use of time: moment of silent, slowest whine about getting no time ever. #GOPDebate
2	That approach abt what ppl do &amp; don't care abt worked during the 1st debate; it's not very original this go round #ChrisChristie! #GOPDebate
2	lol Don't cry Carson. #GOPDebate
2	#bencarson is a cry baby. #GOPDebate
2	Fashion award for the night goes to Dr.  Ben Carson.  #GOPDebate
2	Funny line, but according to @GovChristie , senators do not make decisions that matter. That's what Obama says. Good to know. #GOPDebate
2	@infowars #GOPDebate We know infowars is bigger than the dino media.  What's stopping a debate in Austin with valid questions?
2	Carson asking for a fair shake is hilarious #GOPDebate
2	Carson's time gonna run it before he even answers the actual question. #GOPDebate
2	Yeah but will #BlakeShelton turn around?#GOPDebate
2	Please get this guy off the stage. #ripcarsoncampaign #gottago #GOPDebate
2	Ben Carson throws a childish fit on lack of questions #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate Carson crying he hasn't spoken.
2	Appreciate the common sense approach that @ChrisChristie is taking - it's refreshing. #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	Is everyone else as terrified as me? #GOPDebate #DarkWays
2	Ben Carson is a character for sure #GOPDebate
2	How can you monitor schools and those places? How do you know now without profiling? #GOPDebate
2	Trump gonna burst into flames if he doesn't get more airtime soon #GOPDebate
2	And they're afraid of alienating his supporters. #GOPDebate  https://t.co/oWRfNTnq1z
2	#CNN is really pandering now. #GOPDebate https://t.co/PQtqzZl5JT
2	Shhhhh!!!! Dr. Ben Carson's talking!!!!! #zzzzzzzz #GOPDebate
2	@ChrisChristie NJ was under threat? #thanksforthewarning #GOPDebate
2	Why is like the bottom 5% of the poll getting the most air time....no one cares what @JebBush or @RandPaul have to say #GOPDebate
2	Bad move by @wolfblitzer to try &amp; position @RealBenCarson against @marcorubio or @RandPaul. #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	Damn. #BenCarson sounds a like *radical* J Edgar Hoover in blackface. Can we say #COINTEL boys n girls #GOPDebate #NPRDebate #CNNDebate
2	Just mentioned Reagan!  Jeb please. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate we DO need to get rid of the PC stuff. It is the country's Achilles heel. ‚ù§Ô∏èCarson
2	Playing the #911 #drinkinggame and already nearly through beer 1. Give it a rest. Jeez. #gopdebate
2	Ben Carson just sounds like of the those 'I ain't even trippin'' type of people. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate Sorry I was sleeping I didn't listen to them
2	Ben Carson hates PC language so much, that he can barely open his eyes to complain mildly and in a soft spoken tone about it #GOPDebate
2	.@RealBenCarson fell asleep. That's why he deflected that question about the other sparing candidates. #GOPDebate
2	So no comment on nsa @RealBenCarson ? #GOPDebate
2	Can we talk about the real problems in America, like how Flint Michigan supplied contaminated water to its citizens for a year? #GOPDebate
2	The key to this debate is to trash talk your opponent but not mention their name. That way they don't get 30 extra seconds. #GOPDebate
2	And Ben Carson bitches bout not spkng enough. #GOPDebate  no one FACT checking these blatant liars. #CNNDebate
2	#GOPDebate Scary moment: Jeb Bush is the most rational person on stage right now
2	A peace loving Muslim uses softer rocks to stone gays right Jeb!? #GopDebate
2	Good, I was worried kasichs supporter didn't show up. #GOPDebate
2	Of course they have the ability to do unconstitutional stuff! They're the government! #Duh #GOPDebate
2	Where's Donald? #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate oh snap Ben. Way to call out the moderator
2	Is it me or is Chris Christie gaining weight again? #GOPDebate
2	@ChrisChristie NOBODY wants any of your communist Kool-aid #GOPdebate
2	GOP wants to fight battles on our own, and leave ISIS to the muslims. Can't have it both ways. #GOPDebate
2	Wow. Bad move on Carson‚Äôs part. First, he didn‚Äôt get the red tie memo, now he doesn‚Äôt have an opinion on the NSA programs? #GOPDebate
2	@JebBush makes me miss W. Wow ... even I'm surprised at that. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate I guess @JebBush will never understand that #IslamIsTheProblem So now Jeb is the problem. Drop out.
2	Jeb Bush would probably be cool to smoke weed with #GOPDebate
2	There it is...reference to REAGAN! #BushWhacked #TeamKJ #GOPDebate
2	Sad that @cnn is totally legitimizing the idea of banning Muslims from coming to the United States. #gopdebate
2	Ben Carson is def that nigga than no nigga fux wit #GOPDebate
2	Christie spanks the Senators as 'do nothing' debators. That could be a damaging blow. #CNNDebate #GOPDebate
2	This endless slew of soundbites from the contenders is making my brain hurt. This is horrible. This is intellectually degrading. #GOPDebate
2	the GOP is really debating banning Muslims. #GOPDebateThat tells a lot.
2	Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.Ben Franklin #GOPDebate
2	ISIS must be loving all of the free publicity it is getting right now #GOPDebate
2	Oh shit. I just agreed with Jeb(!) for a second time tonight. I think I'm losing it. This is terrifying. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate @JebBush you just want to suck up to the folks who want is dead. It didn't work in Iraq or Afghanistan. Drop it already
2	#GOPDebate Am I losing it or is Jeb Bush making the most sense out of these jokers?
2	Unamerica activities, Jeb? Maybe form a committee. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate the ate her https://t.co/VzDdI5pyFD
2	Ironically the most PC people I've met use macs. #GOPDebate
2	Jeb is PISSED and his passion is coming through now. #GOPDebate
2	We need to make sure we give the intelligence community the resources they need to keep us safe. @JebBush #GOPDebate #YRWatchParty
2	@DianaValerie Circus or pantomime are the only words to describe the #GOPdebate
2	Thanks for the chuckle, #Carson #GOPDebate
2	.@RealBenCarson lost my respect yrs ago when he canceled a graduation speech because a few students protested.No match for ISIS.#GOPDebate
2	Really? Did @wolfblitzer just drag George Bush into the debate? Liberals - HE IS NO LONGER PRESIDENT! #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	#GOPDebate Jeb! Lil' Bro Shrub sayid Islam is peace. Jeb! Agrees.
2	Ben Carson on the Rubio/Paul argument... dude just got called on in class without having done the reading... #gopdebate
2	#CharlestonShooting #PlannedParenthood  #SandyHook These r terrorists acts 2! Why not talk abt this! #GOPDebate Put it n the same catagory!
2	Typical CNN question. Don't ask real policy question. Ask them who's right. Guess What CNN. THEY ALL WANT TO BE RIGHT, DUH! #GOPDebate
2	@JebBush  Here we go again. Give the Government more power, people less freedom. #GOPDebate
2	Ben Carson, maybe not the next Prez but def a cure for insomnia. #gopdebate
2	Every time #CarlyFiorina speaks my tv somehow gets muted. Weird. #GOPDebate
2	Bush: We can't distance ourselves from peace-loving MuslimsMe: You mean Muslims #GOPDebate
2	Ben Carson is the most boring person to have a political debate with üò¥ #fallingasleep #GOPDebate
2	Right now @RealBenCarson is talking like a Wayans Brothers character. #GOPDEBATE
2	Got a shot of the stage. Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz. These are the top three? #GOPDebate #fullbodycringecontinues
2	So many shots are being fired. You can really tell how pro-gun all of these guys (my bad Carly) are. #GOPDebate #WorstPunEver
2	#GOPDebate The strategy of ostracizing an entire group of people only encourages extremist radicalization. https://t.co/438m8CeoPk
2	Ben Carson: I haven't spoken, I want to speak. Wolf: what do you think about stuff? Ben Carson: oh I don't know. #GOPDebate
2	Wait, is @realDonaldTrump live tweeting while on stage? wtf #GOPDebate
2	Bush making a mistake talking about the FBI.   They are a failure.  The current intelligence is a failure #GOPDebate
2	#gopdebate Bush back-peddles on the question of Islam as peaceful
2	#GOPDebate @realDonaldTrump is being left out of the debate. What a surprise. So transparent, @CNN.
2	#GOPDebate @JebBush the voice of reason at a time when reason is not in fashion.
2	Bush: I opposed terror before Paris!#GOPDebate
2	@RandPaul came out swinging!  #GOPDebate
2	This #GOPDebate is unwatchable. #sophomoric #HighSchool
2	@RandPaul is the only one who GETS IT. We stop radicalization at home by staying OUT of affairs abroad.  #GOPDebate @CNNPolitics
2	Carson handled that dodge witht he skill of a... a... well, something. Ask someone else. #GOPDebate
2	Carson complains about not getting time and has absolutely nothing to say when questioned. #GOPDebate
2	Liberals want to restrict our gun rights, conservatives want to restrict our privacy freedoms. #GOPDebate
2	NO JEB, you SHOULD be talking about the FBI‚Äôs surveillance capabilities out in the public. we kinda deserve to know #GOPDebate
2	#Berniefacts #GOPDebate  Carson: omgomgomg don't involve me, I am Presidenting here!
2	Awww Carson just threw a fit about not being able to speak aww Take your ball and go home #GOPDebate #crockofshit #fuckinglies #FeelTheBern
2	We must combat anti-Muslim bigotry and all forms of discrimination in our country and in our world. #GOPDebate - Bernie Sanders
2	All the above.#GOPDebate  https://t.co/20lAnSrOYS
2	Poor @JebBush is so generic. He's a human bathroom break. #GOPDebate
2	Wolf: Mr. Carson, who was right between Rand and Christie?    Carson: I don't know, I was napping. #GOPDebate
2	My philosophy professor said not to compare things to the holocaust or nazis, but this GOP plan for Muslims... #GOPDebate
2	Christie is always looking at the camera and speaking to the public. Well done governor! Good tactic!  #GOPDebate
2	hey jeb, what kind of assests are u talking about? cuz i dont think that i should be spied on #GOPDebate
2	BEN CARSON AND JEBBY BUSH MUST HAVE WENT TO THE SAME 'PRIVATE SCHOOL' #GOPDebate WOW WOW WOAH... turtle/turtle üò©

2	#GOPDebate #BenCarson I can't comment about 'their' answers, because I was rehearsing mine as they were speaking!
2	3x Ronald Reagan has been mentioned tonight #GOPdebate
2	Carson can't be our first goateed president, right? #GOPDebate
2	Jeb is finally believable. #GOPDebate
2	@JohnJHarwood Is not the #GOPDebate according to #DrCarson a radicalizing event!
2	quote of GW Bush saying Islam is peace is smartest thing said tonight. That guy and smart in the same sentence...but, really. #GOPDebate
2	I think this debate @RealBenCarson  will probably be competing with #WolfBlitzer and commercials #GOPDebate
2	@BuckSexton Reminded me of Oliver Twist there... Please, sir, can I have some more speaking time? Not his best showing.#GOPDebate
2	I'm excited to hear from the President tonight #GOPDebate  https://t.co/wag3WzTiz1
2	#GOPDebate @stinchfield1776 @ChrisChristie is on point tonight
2	#GOPDebate Seems interesting how many things Republicans want to destroy and how few things they want to build
2	Let me see what this #GOPDebate is about
2	Bush thinks that we shouldn't be talking about govt programs in public. Because, Democracy!!!!! #GOPDebate
2	@michaelianblack Remember too that Ben Carson is very concerned about that terrorist group Hummus. #GOPDebate
2	I've always been a Christie fan, and Fiorina... And Kasich... And Trump. Well at least I've decided who indefinitely DON'T Like #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate@Jebbush having a good moment
2	Jeb Bush looks like an old ass baby. #GOPDebate
2	Carson and Trump are radical racists #GOPDebate #Trump2016
2	Wondering why they haven't asked #BenCarson a question? He's not.. #GOPDebate #CNNDebate #BenCarson still sleep
2	@skiplacombe did Carson miss the red tie memo? #oneofthesethingsisnotliketherother #GOPDebate
2	On another note, who names their kid Wolf? #GOPDebate
2	we cant disassociate ourselves with muslims thats just ridiculous #GOPDebate
2	How did @RealBenCarson complain about not getting speaking time but when given an opportunity he runs and hides! #GOPDebate
2	He Does #GOPDebate #Trump2016  https://t.co/afVedmC1sy
2	‚Äú@TomRichey: WHERE IS TRUMP??? #GOPDebate‚Äù#chsgapchat
2	#GOPDebate I'm going to let you finish but #TheVoice has dancing chimpanzees onstage right now with Coldplay.
2	#Carson doesn't want say who won the debate between Paul &amp; Rubio? Sorry don't want a lover, want a fighter for POTUS! #weak #GOPDebate
2	Man, when I go gray, I want to gray like Jeb Bush. #MensAppearanceMatters #SilverFox #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate I kinda like #randpaul
2	G.W. Bush was wrong #GOPDebate
2	@GovChristie indicts the voting public claiming the electorate is disinterested in policy. No wonder policy is not central #Zeall #GOPDebate
2	@jonlovett @jonfavs Christie acknowledges the short attention span of the republican base. #gopdebate
2	#GOPDebate  Chris Christie would trade your freedom for a dick sandwich in a heart beat
2	These guys are more interested in trashing talking each other than answering questions üòÇüòÇüòÇ #GOPDebate
2	Did Carly Fiorina steal Mr. T's necklace? #GOPDebate
2	Christie just served the dithering Cruz, Rubio and Paul! Boom! Then Dr.Carson whines about time!? ü§îüò© #GOPDebate
2	Answer the f**king question. #GOPdebate
2	Jeb Bush:Don't You Wonk Me, Baby?#80sMusic #HumanLeague #GOPDebate https://t.co/zqLSpOlPkL
2	Carly's talking? Twitter break. #GOPDebate
2	Carson: I haven't had a chance to share my opinion. Wolf: share your opinion. Carson: no thanks. #GOPDebate
2	From 2000-2012, child care costs for middle class families grew by 30% #WithinReach #GOPdebate
2	Too much tech/social media gobbleygook by Fiorina. Move on. Unelectable. #GOPDebate
2	If we expect to do this on our own, we will fail. We need peaceful Muslims' help. - Jeb Bush #GOPDebate What's going on when I AGREE w/ him?
2	Algorithms? That's how we stop terrorism? Will the GOP base buy this? #GOPDebate
2	In 1979, @JebBush ran into some serious financial issues? #DIdYouKnow #GOPDebate #CBN2016 https://t.co/g8gMmyeEv5
2	Why did we miss the Planned Parenthood shooter or Sandy Hook hmmm? @CarlyFiorina  #GOPDebate #NoHateDebate
2	Let the government follow you on twitter pls #GOPDebate
2	Carly Fiorina explicitly stating that she wants govt to behave like nosey parents. #GOPDebate #Cato2016
2	Eeyore or Dr Carson? I don't intend to be mean but this is about issues, make yourself relevant, don't  whine about lack of time #gopdebate
2	Get out of my social media, mom. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate Can someone get this camera person a tissue?!?!
2	The answer should be no Fiorina, GOP wants less Gov! Can't make the private sector do anything!  #GOPDebate
2	Government is behind the technology curve ~ @CarlyFiorina on #SanBernadinoShooting #GOPDebate
2	Trump has been fairly quiet so far. And that's fine by him: He doesn't need to make much noise as long as he leads polls. #GOPDebate
2	Islam is not peace, it's an Abrahamic religion just like Christianity &amp; Judaism. NO RELIGION is peace, just a lot of beliefs. #GOPDebate
2	Fiorina thinks we're behind the curve in technology. Meanwhile, my HP printer is the worst piece of shit I ever spent money on #GOPDebate
2	If parents are doing something, the government should have the same rights! #GOPDebate
2	#Fiorina: Capitalism will help fight terrorism with big tech #GOPDebate
2	@CarlyFiorina please give us the algorithm to eradicate terrorism #GOPDebate so jokes
2	The fact that half of Americans consider this radical conservatism normal genuinely scares me. #PrayforAmerica #GOPDebate
2	@dbartram22 Me too, our conservatives are hippies compared to these candidates in the #GOPDebate
2	Bush: We shouldn't be talking about this out in public. Tell the media. BTW, yourselves on stage, too  #GOPDebate
2	You know it's a problem when McCarthy era-isms are used in the #GOPDebate
2	Fiorina has a point - gov generally seems to be behind the curve on tech. #GOPDebate
2	Carly said she'd been called every b-word in the book... But I bet it was mostly just a bitch #GOPDebate
2	Carly Fiorina reminds me of the uptight aunt who would lecture a Starbucks barista for getting her drink wrong #GOPDebate
2	Carly ALWAYS comes across as a uppity elitist who acts like she knows everything. That's why she's Peggy Noonan to me. lol #GOPDebate
2	NETFLIX ALGORITHM FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!! #GOPDebate
2	.@RealBenCarson Distracting fear-mongering! We need love &amp; compassion &amp; justice for the vulnerable! #GOPDebate  https://t.co/2vcIY8cum8
2	So glad I passed on drinking game. I'd be in drunken stupor right now. #GOPDebate
2	So what I've gotten from tonight's #GOPDebate is that @hughhewitt &amp; @StephenKing look a lot alike.
2	#GOPDebate  maybe we should just make a refugee camp with all the comfort they want and send them back when Isis is destroyed:')

2	I am pretty sure @realDonaldTrump has no idea how the internet works and Ben Carson has no ideas how the military works. #GOPDebate
2	@People4Bernie @CNN would've rather watched Supermarket Sweep than the #GOPDebate. Supermarket Sweep was the shit.
2	What's more important? The lives and safety of Americans or whoever wins the Voice? #GOPDebate #VoiceFinale

2	@P0TUS if we could convince them to take Fiorina to run their tech, the war would be over #GOPDebate

2	Carson: MOAR dictators in the Middle East #GOPDebate

2	#Carson: The Middle East has been in turmoil for thousands of years...since pyramids were used as grain silos #GOPDebate
2	Ding ding. Times up. These GOP guys and guys don't follow rules. #gopdebate
2	OMG shut up Ted Cruz. Rude, rude, rude. #GOPDebate #uncouth

2	Cruz is so rude #GOPdebate
2	@wolfblitzer telling @tedcruz to shutup#GOPDebate
2	Omg @tedcruz is proving why nobody likes him #GOPDebate

2	If women were world leaders, there would be no wars just jealous countries not talking to each other #CarlyFiorina #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	@CarlyFiorina is correct @POTUS is responsible for ISIS, he created them, funded them and watch the grow. A mess #GOPDebate
2	Hi, can I speak to the Supreme Leader please? Tell him it's Carly. #GOPDebate
2	Does anyone else wish they were watching the #GOPDebate with Bernie Sanders?
2	@TIME bend their hineys over and give them a serious spanking. really mean it. #GOPDebate
2	Christie: Totally cool with attacking Russian forces in Syria. Totally cool with antagonizing a nuclear power. Totally nuts. #GOPDebate
2	Gov. Christie is one of those people who thinks that if you say it strongly enough, then you're right. #GOPDebate
2	Fiorina is stupid! Spreading lies in the #GOPDebate again. Bush aka G'Dubya negotiated withdrawal of the troops before he left office.
2	This is a fucking roast session!! #GOPDebate
2	@realDonaldTrump to Jeb Bush tonight #GOPDebate https://t.co/jdWbvwT2Yr

2	Christie: President weak link is in the Oval Office now.#GOPDebate
2	The Demagogue in chief wants to shoot down Russian planes? Yikes #GOPDebate
2	What about a no-fly zone in America? No guns for terrorists on the No-Fly Watch List! #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate Last I checked, ISIS doesn't have a fighter jets!?!?
2	#GOPDebate no he didn't call President Obama a name?
2	It's time to punch those Russians in the nose #GOPDebate üò©üò©
2	Better than a no fly zone, Gov. Christie would set up some rolling construction zones and that would really frustrate Russia. #GOPDebate
2	In all seriousness, all this anti Russian rhetoric is so damn dangerous. I can't believe these people are able to run for office. #GOPDebate
2	THERE'S THE @CarlyFiorina I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!! #SheSlays #GOPDebate #PresidentFiorina

2	I would close his FUCKIN lanes down! #GOPDebate
2	Why would we institute a no fly zone if Russia is launching attacks on ISIS #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	The GOP debate is my favorite comedy. Can't wait til all the episodes come out on @netflix #GOPDebate #gop #DeportTrump
2	Viewer Q for Fiorina basically paraphrased: Are you sure your Putin response wasn't ridiculously childish? #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebateO starting to take some body blows and an upper cut
2	#GOPDebate Rubio and Carly should have worn military uniforms tonight.
2	Rand: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in favor of world war 3, you have your candidate‚Äù towards Christie. #StandWithRand #RandRally #GOPDebate
2	Ben Carson used up his intro time to dedicate a moment of silence üòÇ #GOPDebate
2	I am watching Carly Fiorina and wondering if a woman can be a Dickhead.   #GOPDebate
2	Rand with the subtweet #GOPDebate
2	It sounds like Christie wanted to use a different F word in regards to Obama. #GOPDebate
2	Governor Christie tried Barack üòê #GOPdebate
2	The next president needs to be able to prioritize logically. Current threats, then potential threats.#GOPDebate
2	Did Chris Christie just say he would shoot down the plane in a no fly zone even if Putin was in the plane?!#GOPDebate #fb
2	That was poor Christie-very poor.     #GOPDebate
2	@RandPaul is criminal dictator #Assad best friend #USA #US #Syria #GOPDebate
2	Is Chris Christe under the impression that New Jersey is some kind of Utopian beacon he created from nothing? #GOPDebate
2	Wonder if Obama is listening and taking tips #GOPDebate
2	This debate is ridiculous. No one observes the rules. And @RandPaul clearly paid for a cheering section. And they are dumb.#gopdebate
2	#GOPDebate if you want something talked about ask a man, if you want something done ask a woman @carlyfigueroa. Voting for @HillaryClinton
2	If you can't wait for WW3, vote for @ChrisChristie. #GOPDebate
2	Who does fiorina not know?? #GOPDebate
2	@CarlyFiorina keeps attacking democrats like she has the nomination. You're still in the primaries and you're losing! #GOPDebate
2	Christie: This president is a feckless feckin feck face. #GOPDebate
2	I just don't know how @ChrisChristie really feels. I wish he would tell us. #GOPDebate
2	Please Lord, somehow put @CarlyFiorina in a debate with @HillaryClinton #RouseyVSholm 2.0 #GOPDebate Fiorina would destroy Clinton..
2	WOW! @ChrisChristie just went balls deep into @BarackObama! #GOPDebate
2	Somehow I don't think @ChrisChristie would look Putin in the eyes and say that. #GOPDebate
2	@JoyAnnReid Christie is prepared to go to war? we are shooting down Russians?  You can't put your cronies in to do ur bidding #GOPDebate
2	classy #GOPDebate  https://t.co/altcMPOzAL
2	Probably do not start a war with Russia... probably not a good idea #GOPDebate
2	#Fiorina nails it on why #ISIS came to power: Obama's power vacuum #GOPDebate
2	Wait wait wait did Christie just sneak an airplane pun into his inability to articulate an argument? #puns #GOPDebate
2	#GOPdebateI wouldn't set up a no fly zone without Russia agreement
2	Christie would start a war with Russia because he's the boss. Can't wait for him to leave my state. #GOPDebate
2	@CNNPolitics American lives on the line by inaction n Syria matter should more 2 US Pres Syrian lives @ risk.#GOPDebate #AmericanLivesMatter

2	Uhm...It's not our no-fly zone. Governor Front Butt. #GOPDebate STEEERRRRRIIIKKEEEEE TWOOOOOOOOO https://t.co/5JB3qYuA0f
2	Yes it's Obama's fault for withdrawing in 2011, but no Bush's fault for invading in the first place makes total sense #GOPDebate
2	Let's just stay at war forever. We'll just kill and fight and fuck and who cares #GOPDebate
2	Good for Carly pointing out that at great cost Iraq was won and Obama gave it away. #GOPDebate
2	Did Christie just say be would shoot down a plane even if Putin's in it? #GOPDebate
2	ISIS does not have fighter jets. A No Fly Zone does nothing to fight them. #GOPDebate
2	Not starting a war with Russian is feckless weakness? Tell that to every Cold War president. Also, RP on point! #Cato2016 #GOPDebate
2	@CarlyFiorina is spilling all of Victoria's Secrets tonight. #GOPDebate
2	@ChrisChristie wants to shoot down #Russian planes. Utter madness. People are really trying to lose my vote. #GOPDebate
2	@ChrisChristie would you shut down all the bridges to Russia then #GOPDebate
2	How many of these assholes really want to get into a war with Russia? Really, am I dreaming? #gopdebate
2	@GovChristie says he would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if they were to violate a no-fly zone in Syria #GOPDebate
2	Ok the fact is the only 2 that aren't totally scary are Rubio and Bush #GOPDebate
2	I've never heard the word feckless before. #GOPDebate
2	.@GovChristie got huge applause for his feckless comment about Obama. #GOPDebate
2	Chris Christie would take on Russia like it were a bucket of fried chicken. #GOPDebate
2	Trump was like 'What is the Geneva Convention?' and to hell with the Constitution'   #GOPDebate
2	Can anyone tell me where @ChrisChristie is from? I'm not quite sure. #GOPDebate
2	Imagine a NO FLY Zone being a NO FLY ZONE @GovChristie #GOPDebate
2	Christie - BAM! #GOPDebate
2	Suddenly lots of nose talk. #GOPDebate
2	So John Kasich and Christie want to go to war with Russia #GOPDebate
2	In another age, Chris Christie would be a phenomenal money laundering restaurant owner for the Gambino Crime Faily. #GOPDebate
2	We need more money for the military.  We need to collect less money with taxes.  #GOPDebate
2	Light them Ruskies up! #GOPDebate
2	Okay folks, an hour in and we've firmly established that @HillaryClinton is the worst thing to ever happen if you're a republican #GOPDebate
2	@Jason_Stapleton #GOPDebate #ChrisChristie World War 3 is not off the table!
2	CHRISTIE: I'll shoot down the Russians if they go in the no-fly zone. #gopdebate

2	Damn Jeb is pretty withering tonight. Got that good training. Slingin zingers like a mug. #GOPDebate
2	C - Especially from the guy who just said one cannot insult one's way to the White House #GOPDebate
2	@RandPaul @ChrisChristie @realDonaldTrump let's remember who we are fighting, and it's not the other republicans. #GOPDebate @DefundDC
2	We don't have an empire. It's just our job to decide who rules in every country in the world. #GOPDebate
2	Who's this guy with the silver hair? He looks like Leslie Nielsen. #GOPdebate
2	This food fight needs boxing gloves soon ... #GOPDebate I'm upgrading my buttered popcorn to caramelized Cracker jacks
2	Ben Carson only listens to a few words of the questions hes asked and then just goes w/whatever anecdote comes into his head #GOPDebate
2	lol this guy, still pretending there are smart republicans left #GOPDebate https://t.co/6Kp9TjhWxz
2	I disagree with most of his positions, but Rand Paul's reactions to his fellow candidates crazy is SPOT ON #GOPDebate
2	It's possible Jeb is having the best night. Jeb Bush. Former Governor of Florida. Bush, Jeb. #GOPDebate
2	.@JebBush: I am more qualified because I know what I don't know, and would get the best advice. #GOPDebate
2	I didn't want to throw up &amp; did NOT watch the #GOPDebate #Latinos https://t.co/TGMelpUuNw
2	Wow!  BAM!  #GOPDebate   gloves are off baby.  Then, I know what I don't know. omg.  Jeb is so lame.

2	#GOPDebate Republican's don't want to spend any money!  How they going to do what they say?
2	'I know what I don't know''I won't seek out my information from the shows'Jeb Bush taking Donald Trump to the cleaners #GOPDebate
2	#gopdebate VOTE #Trump2016 Oh #JebBush you did not listen to mom when she said we don't need another Bush
2	Rand Paul said think about judgement of someone who might shut down a bridge. #GOPdebate https://t.co/FRJPVsNwin
2	@RandPaul is looking VERY strong in his response on No-Fly zone in Syria. This has been his best #GOPDebate so far, in my book.
2	Look how disgraceful @cnn split screens Trump/Bush when asking baited questions. #gopdebate
2	Jeb Bush just said that Trump gets his ideas from cartoons!!!!! #savage #GOPDebate
2	#Bush talking *drink* #GOPDebate
2	So the Trump-Bush fight is basically a sideshow to the #GOPDebate this time around, the real debate seems to be Cruz vs Rubio vs Paul.
2	#GOPDebate #Paul brought up #Christie's bridge deal! Oh no you dint!
2	Christie is a far bigger embarrassment to my state than those Jersey Shore kids or those women on Real Housewives could ever be #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate I can't believe I'm about to say this but thank god Bush is talking.
2	@MaryannKay @MPHaus Is Paul competing with Trump for 'Wacky Hairdo of the Year' ?..This is why I drink...#GOPDebate
2	Carley Paul and Florina should win #GOPDebate
2	Trump bout to pounce on Jeb. #GOPDebate
2	Aaaaaaand Rand Paul brings up #bridgegate, but Christie doesn't take the bait. #GOPDebate
2	Jeb's got jokes #GOPdebate
2	Yes, pump up our military. Let's forget about pumping up our education system. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate Bush a waste of air time.#WhataWOOSIE
2	Why do these candidates keep saying our military is too small? Has anyone seen a budget lately? #GOPDebate
2	john Kasich owes me child support #GOPDebate
2	How can a candidate say he wants to go to war with Russia and create a World war? #GOPdebate
2	There's a special kind of duckface that Trump makes when Jeb! hits him.  See if you can catch it.  #GOPDebate
2	Bridgehate came up. Love it. Go back to Jersey and eat yourself to heart disease. #GOPDebate
2	Love how they can't say Obama's name without Hillary Clinton's, and vice versa. #GOPDebate #messaging
2	#GOPDebate trump is about to nail Jeb....
2	Rick Santorum is still pathetically polling at 0.3% despite #GOPDebate. #Moderates #Independents #Democrats #Libertarians #Occupy #Anonymous
2	Trump is striking that Il Duce pose tonight. #GOPDebate
2	Bush knows what he doesn‚Äôt know: Which must include running a presidential campaign. #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDEBATE Recruit the illegals for the armed forces as part of the road to citizenship.
2	Bush is not going to be a lot of things in chief. #GOPDebate
2	#Rand is thoughtful, a planner, not impulsive or reckless. #Russia is already in Air Space, bcz US has been #leadingFromBehind #GOPDebate
2	#GOPDebate Bush is right about this: our military has been decimated by this friggin' cluster-you-know-what
2	Insulting our President and Hilary Clinton is not a policy #GOPDebate
2	Please, Republicans. Tell us more about how you're totally different than Donald Trump. #GOPDebate ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/nMSgM8ojnX
2	Thus continues the ongoing conflict between @RandPaul and @ChrisChristie. #GOPDebate
2	This moment defined self-control on the part of @ChrisChristie . Kudos #GOPdebate  https://t.co/CXY8KVcfuN
2	So apparently the bell is being interpreted as the two minute warning. Oh bell, let me go for my best play #GOPDebate
2	That comment from #Randpaul proves he's a child that's why the kids like him #GOPDebate
2	please, oh, pretty please, twitter-sphere, someone speed up Katich‚Äôs hand movements during #GOPDebate and add some kungfu music
2	Bush doesn't know Saturday from Sunday. He's heard of Wednesday, thinks he met one once #GOPDebate
2	Jeb is just so rude.... so sad for him #GOPDEBATE @CNN @realDonaldTrump
2	Jeb Bush: Blah, blah, blah...Putin, advice...blah blah armed forces blah #GOPDebate #TCOT #LNYHBT  #CruzCrew https://t.co/BWisDaBXm0

2	I refuse to talk to another world leader!! They are mean and poopy!! #highschooltactic #GOPDebate
2	@RealBenCarson is the only consistent and solid person tonight on #GOPDebate
2	Bush just roasted Trump, saying he's not sure if he gets his info from Saturday morning cartoons. Lolz. #GOPDebate
2	We're hearing a lot about World War III during the #GOPDebate. Is that a threat, a fear or a hope?
2	This just might be Jeb Bush's better debates so far.  #GOPDebate
2	Bush: I would seek out the best advice you can get...not consult the shows. #burn #GOPDebate
2	Bush's strategy is to create a strategy #GOPDebate

2	#randpaul #GOPDebate #ohnohediint Really did Rand Paul just throw a LOW blow at Christy? Wow thought he was better than that!
2	#GOPDebate would be more interesting if they all wrestled each other to the death. or at least tried to pull off @realDonaldTrump's hair.
2	#GOPDebate How many people on that stage actually served in the military?
2	I'm not too sure it's so legal for one nation to just impose a no-fly zone over a foreign nation. Neither are drone strikes. #GOPDebate
2	Jeb jabs Trump very clever, but very late.  Where were you in August? #GOPDebate #CNNDebate
2	Bush zinged Trump.... #GOPDebate
2	man, haven't heard about that bridge in a while. low blow, but i still laughed. @RandPaul @GovChristie #GOPDebate

2	Wow @RandPaul just slapped @ChrisChristie #GOPDebate #Bridgegate
2	We all know what YOU don't know! @JebBush #GOPDebate

2	Why are republicans just by nature (hmm what's the politically correct word) crazy? #GOPDebate
2	Oh, that's cute. Jeb! thinks that Saturday Morning Cartoons are still a thing. #GOPDebate
2	What I've learned from the #GOPDebate They want to start World War 3 as quickly as possible. Wonderful
